Title: Head down tilt 15° increases cerebral perfusion before recanalization in acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. A pre-clinical MRI study
Authors: Simone Beretta, Davide Carone, Tae-Hee Cho, Martina Viganò, Susanna Diamanti, Jacopo Mariani, Francesco Pedrazzini, Elisa Bianchi, Cristiano Pini, Radu Bolbos, Marlene Wiart, Carlo Ferrarese, Fabien Chauveau
Preregistration: preclinicaltrials.eu, identifier PCTE0000198

Raw data:

	MRI for 28 adult male Wistar rats (ILAR code Crl:WI(Han); RRID:RGD_2308816)
	Magnetic field: 7T
	Anesthesia: isoflurane
	Time points (in hours, following occlusion): H0 (during MCA occlusion); H24 (after reperfusion)
	Ethics statement: agreement numbers APAFIS#15529-2018061512184831v2 and 32924-2021091015062327v4 from local committee CELYNE-CNREEA (C2EA-42, Lyon, France)

Derivatives:

	Time-to-Peak (TTP) maps calculated from DSC-PWI 
	Matlab code used for TTP calculation
	Excel files describing the experimental series and the main results

Notes:

	No specification is available for Dynamic-Susceptibility-Contrast Perfusion-Weighted-Imaging (DSC-PWI), so the corresponding files are labelled in .bidsignore 
	R10 had no anatomical T2w on H0
	H24 session could not be performed for 8 animals  (R03-R10-R26-R28-R29-R31-R33-R34)
	R28 was not positioned properly during the first run of DSC-PWI, positioning was corrected for the second run
